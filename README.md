# @intelligentplant/ng-ias-app-template

An example app for the [Intelligent Plant Industrial App Store](https://appstore.intelligentplant.com), using the following technologies:

* [Angular 6](https://angular.io)
* [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io)
* [Bulma](https://bulma.io)
* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com)

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.2.3.

## Getting Started

You must create a new Industrial App Store app registration at the [Industrial App Store developer portal](https://appstore.intelligentplant.com/developer/home). Register `http://localhost:4200/login-callback` as the application's redirect URI.

Once you have registered your app, copy the app's App ID into the placeholder location in `src/app-info.ts`.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
